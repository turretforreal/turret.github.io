            <h2>ENGINE OIL</h2>
            <h3>CHECKING OIL LEVEL</h3>
            <p>
                To assure proper engine lubrication, the engine oil must be maintained at the correct level. Check the oil level at regular intervals, such as once a month. The best time to check the engine oil level is about five minutes after a fully warmed engine is shut off. 
                Checking the oil while the vehicle is on level ground will improve the accuracy of the oil level readings. Maintain the oil level in the "SAFE" range. Adding 1.0 quart (.95 liters) of oil when the reading is at the bottom of the "SAFE" range will result in an oil level at the top of the "SAFE" range on these engines.
            </p>
            <h3>CHANGE ENGINE OIL</h3>
            <p>
                The oil change indicator system will remind you that it is time to take your vehicle in for scheduled maintenance. Refer to "Maintenance Schedule" for further information. 
            </p>
            <em>
                NOTE: Under no circumstances should oil change inter­vals exceed 6,000 miles (10,000 km) or six months, whichever occurs first.
            </em>
            <h3>ENGINE OIL SELECTION</h3>
            <p>
                For best performance and maximum protection under all types of operating conditions, the manufacturer only recommends full synthetic engine oils that meet the American Petroleum Institute (API) categories of SN. 
                The manufacturer recommends the use of Pennzoil Ultra 0W-40 engine or equivalent MOPAR oil meeting the FCA Material Standard MS-12633 for use in all operating temperatures. 
                The engine oil filler cap also shows the recommended engine oil viscosity for your engine. For information on engine oil filler cap location, refer to "Engine Compart­ment" in "Maintaining Your Vehicle" for further informa­tion.
            </p>
            <h3>ENGINE OIL VISCOSITY</h3>
            <p>
                Use Pennzoil Ultra 0W-40 engine or equivalent MOPAR oil meeting the FCA Material Standard MS-12633 for use in all operating temperatures. 
                The engine oil filler cap also shows the recommended engine oil viscosity for your engine. For information on engine oil filler cap location, refer to "Engine Compart­ment" in "Maintaining Your Vehicle" for further informa­tion.
            </p>
            <h3>SYNTHETIC ENGINE OILS</h3>
            <p>
                You may use synthetic engine oils provided the recom­mended oil quality requirements are met, and the recom­mended maintenance intervals for oil and filter changes are followed. 
                Synthetic engine oils which do not have both the engine oil certification mark and the correct SAE viscosity grade number should not be used. 
            </p>
            <h3>MATERIALS ADDED TO ENGINE OIL</h3>
            <p>
                The manufacturer strongly recommends against the ad­dition of any additives (other than leak detection dyes) to the engine oil. Engine oil is an engineered product, and its performance may be impaired by supplemental additives.
            </p>
            <h3>DISPOSING OF USED ENGINE OIL AND OIL FILTERS</h3>
            <p>
                Care should be taken in disposing of used engine oil and oil filters from your vehicle. Used oil and oil filters, indiscriminately discarded, can present a problem to the environment. Contact your authorized dealer, service station or governmental agency for advice on how and where used oil and oil filters can be safely discarded in your area.
